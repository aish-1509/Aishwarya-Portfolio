## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You'll need a modern web browser. To run a local server, you can use Python or Node.js.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/aish-1509/Aishwarya-Portfolio.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd Aishwarya-Portfolio
    ```

### Running Locally

You can open the `index.html` file directly in your browser, or for a more robust experience (to avoid any CORS issues with future API calls), run a local server.

-   **Using Python:**
    ```sh
    python -m http.server
    ```
-   **Using Node.js (with `serve` package):**
    ```sh
    npx serve .
    ```

## üîß Configuration

To adapt the portfolio for your own use, you'll need to update the following:

-   **Personal Information:** Edit `index.html` to change the text content, project details, and personal links.
-   **GitHub Integration:** In `script.js`, update the GitHub username to fetch your own repository data:
    ```javascript
    const username = 'YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME';
    ```
-   **Resume:** Replace the PDF file in the `assets/` directory and update the corresponding link in `index.html`.
